            <p class="story">The old piano sat untouched in the corner of the attic, covered in a thick layer of dust. No one had played it in years—not since Grandma Eleanor passed away. But when Maya stumbled upon it while searching for an old book, something drew her in.

                She ran her fingers across the keys, pressing down hesitantly. A soft, broken tune filled the air, and she shivered. The sound was familiar, yet distant, like an echo from a dream.
                
                Curious, Maya lifted the piano lid and found a folded note hidden beneath the strings. The paper was yellowed with age, but the handwriting was unmistakable—Grandma Eleanor’s.
                
                "For the one who remembers the melody, I leave my greatest secret."
                
                Maya’s heart pounded. A secret? She closed her eyes and tried to recall the lullaby her grandmother used to play for her. Slowly, she pressed the keys, the melody weaving itself into the silence of the attic.
                
                As the final note rang out, a soft click echoed from inside the piano. Maya gasped as a hidden compartment slid open, revealing a small velvet box. Inside, nestled among silk, was a delicate golden locket. She opened it with trembling fingers and found a tiny photograph—her grandmother as a young girl, standing beside another woman who looked almost identical to her.
                
                A name was etched inside: "Lillian."
                
                Maya had never heard of her. Who was this mysterious woman, and why had Grandma kept her a secret?
                
                As she held the locket, a warm breeze swept through the attic, and for just a moment, Maya swore she heard a whisper.
                
                "Find her."
                
                Maya knew then—this was only the beginning.</p>
